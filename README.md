# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
## Overview
This project demonstrates the capability of real-time facial emotion recognition using Python, OpenCV, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to classify the emotion on a personâ€™s face into one of seven categories, using live video from a webcam.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implements facial detection in real-time video streams.
- **Emotion Classification**: Classifies detected faces into one of seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise.
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays the emotion classification results directly on the video feed with bounding box and label.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The core programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV (cv2):** For capturing video streams and image processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** For designing and training the convolutional neural network.
